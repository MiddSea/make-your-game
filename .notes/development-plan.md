# Breakout Game Development Plan

## Current Status

- ✅ Basic game structure created
- ✅ MDA framework documented
- ✅ 60 FPS game loop implemented
- ✅ Smooth keyboard controls
- ✅ Basic collision detection

## TODO List

### Phase 1: Core Mechanics ✅

- [x] Game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Paddle movement (smooth, continuous)
- [x] Ball physics
- [x] Basic collision detection

### Phase 2: Visual Polish

- [ ] Add visual effects for brick destruction
- [ ] Add particle effects
- [ ] Improve ball trail effect
- [ ] Add sound effects (optional)

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement efficient collision detection (spatial partitioning)
- [ ] Monitor FPS with Performance API
- [ ] Optimize DOM updates
- [ ] Add FPS counter display

### Phase 4: Game Feel

- [ ] Add power-ups (multi-ball, wider paddle, etc.)
- [ ] Implement different brick types
- [ ] Add bonus levels
- [ ] High score persistence

### Phase 5: Testing & Debugging

- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Ensure consistent 60 FPS
- [ ] Fix any input lag issues
- [ ] Balance difficulty curve

## Known Issues

- None yet

## Performance Notes

- Using transform instead of left/top for better performance
- Batching DOM updates where possible
- Using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation

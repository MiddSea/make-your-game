**Session End**: 5:15 AM after 24hrs awake  
**Status**: Ready to continue game development tasks  
**Current Branch**: `feature/fps60_after_audit`  
**Location**: `/Users/sean.middleton/gitea/smiddleto/make-your-game`

---

## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

### Git Workflow & Backup

- âœ… Successfully backed up `feature/fps60_after_audit` to both gitea and GitHub
- âœ… Created safety instructions for Ubuntu laptop: `.notes/UBUNTU-LAPTOP-SAFETY-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- âœ… Backed up GitHub-only commits as `github-main-backup` and `github-dev-backup`
- âœ… Pushed 3 local commits to both remotes (no more "ahead by 3" status)
- âœ… Verified `feature/instructions` branch (game UI instructions) is backed up

### Git Status Summary

- **Current**: `feature/fps60_after_audit` branch, clean working tree
- **Remotes**: Both gitea/origin and github working correctly
- **Branches exist on both remotes**: main, dev, feature/fps60_after_audit, feature/instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PRIORITY TASKS

### Immediate Game Development (Audit Requirements)

**1. Test & Verify 60 FPS Implementation**

```bash
# Open game in browser and test
open index.html
# Check browser console for FPS info
# Verify it's running at 60 FPS not 30 FPS
```

**2. Implement Timer/Countdown Functionality**

- **Issue**: "There is no timer. That needs to be implemented"
- **Files to examine**: `game.js`, `index.html`
- **Requirement**: Add visible countdown/timer clock to the game

**3. Implement Proper Layer Separation**

- **Issue**: "Layers, technically there are no layers as such that would be seen in Chrome"
- **Target**: At least 2-4 layers:
  1. Pop-up screens, game over, start screen
  2. Paddle and ball
  3. Bricks and scores  
  4. Background, pop-up at bottom, keys and their function

# Breakout Game Project Plan

## Overview

Creating a Breakout game using vanilla JavaScript following the MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) framework.

## Project Requirements (from brief)

- No frameworks or canvas - plain JS/DOM and HTML only
- 60 FPS performance with smooth animations
- Keyboard-only controls
- Pause menu functionality
- Classic Breakout gameplay

## MDA Framework Application

### Mechanics (Rules and Components)

- **Ball**: Bounces off walls, paddle, and blocks
- **Paddle**: Player-controlled, moves horizontally
- **Blocks**: Destructible targets arranged in patterns
- **Lives**: Limited attempts before game over
- **Score**: Points awarded for breaking blocks

### Dynamics (Behavior and Interactions)

- Ball physics and collision detection
- Paddle movement and ball deflection
- Block destruction patterns
- Power-ups (future enhancement)
- Level progression

### Aesthetics (Emotional Response)

- Retro arcade visual style (as per screenshot)
- Satisfying block destruction feedback
- Tension from ball speed increase
- Achievement from clearing levels

## Technical Architecture

- **Model**: Game state (ball position, blocks, score)
- **View**: DOM manipulation for rendering
- **Controller**: Input handling and game loop

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Basic game structure and rendering
2. **Phase 2**: Ball physics and collision detection
3. **Phase 3**: Paddle control and interaction
4. **Phase 4**: Block grid and destruction
5. **Phase 5**: Game states (menu, playing, paused, game over)
6. **Phase 6**: Scoring and lives system
7. **Phase 7**: Polish and performance optimization

## Key Technologies

- **requestAnimationFrame**: For 60 FPS game loop
- **DOM manipulation**: For rendering without canvas
- **CSS**: For visual styling
- **Event listeners**: For keyboard input

## Performance Considerations

- Use CSS transforms for smooth movement
- Batch DOM updates
- Optimize collision detection
- Monitor frame rate with Performance API

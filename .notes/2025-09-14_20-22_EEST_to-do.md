I want to do three things. These are my main tasks.
  Do not do anything, Claude Code unless I specifically ask you.

  BACKGROUND: I have submitted the project and had an audit. 
  During the audit three requirements failed.

  in @.notes/make-your-game-01-edu-audit-readme.md
  ```
  - Does the countdown/timer clock seem to be working?
  - Can you confirm that the layers are being used as little as possible?
  - Is layer creation being promoted properly? 
  - Does the game run at/or around 60fps? (from 50 to 60 or more)
  ```

  Answers:
  ### Timer
  There is not timer. That needs to be implemented
  ### Layers
  Layers, technically there are no layers as such that would be seen in Chrome. Ideally we should have at 
  least two, better 3 or 4:
  4. pop up screens, game over, start screen
  3. paddle and ball
  2.Bricks and scores
  1.Background, pop up at bottom, keys and their function
  ### 60 FPS
  It is actually 30 FPS at the minute. The game loop actually does unnessary stuff that can be sucessfully 
  eliminated

  0 Task
  - Sort out git script/workflow to save local changes in feature. Name it, document it, comment,  tag it, 
  merge (!!!!!) it with existing remote stuff on that branch,
  then merge feature with dev branch
  then merge working dev branch with main 
  - 


  Three tasks:
  1. Change FPS by cutting out unnessary code in game loop. 
     Test that.

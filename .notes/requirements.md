# Project Requirements & Constraints

## From the Official Brief

### Must Have ✅

1. **No frameworks or canvas** - Plain JS/DOM and HTML only
2. **60 FPS performance** - Smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame
3. **Keyboard-only controls** - No mouse interaction
4. **Smooth controls** - No key spamming, continuous action on key hold
5. **Pause functionality** - Pause, restart, continue at any time
6. **Genre adherence** - Classic Breakout gameplay

### Technical Requirements

- **Performance monitoring** using browser Developer Tools
- **No frame drops** when paused
- **Consistent motion** throughout gameplay
- **Plain DOM manipulation** for all rendering

### What We're Building

A classic Breakout game where:

- A ball bounces around the screen
- Player controls a paddle to keep ball in play
- Blocks are destroyed when hit by the ball
- Game ends when all lives are lost
- Score increases as blocks are destroyed

### Key Learning Objectives

1. **requestAnimationFrame** usage
2. **DOM manipulation** techniques
3. **Performance optimization**
4. **Event handling** for smooth input
5. **Game state management**
6. **Collision detection** algorithms

### Performance Tools to Use

- **Performance Tab**: Monitor FPS and frame drops
- **Paint Flashing**: Visualize DOM updates
- **Console**: Debug and log performance metrics
- **Network Tab**: Monitor asset loading

### Constraints That Make This Interesting

1. **No Canvas** means we must:
   - Use DOM elements for all game objects
   - Optimize CSS transforms for movement
   - Batch DOM updates efficiently
   - Be creative with rendering techniques

2. **60 FPS requirement** means we must:
   - Profile constantly during development
   - Optimize every piece of code
   - Use efficient algorithms
   - Minimize DOM manipulations

3. **Keyboard-only** means we must:
   - Implement proper key state tracking
   - Handle simultaneous key presses
   - Ensure responsive controls
   - Provide good visual feedback

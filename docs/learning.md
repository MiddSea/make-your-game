# Learning Journal

This document tracks the concepts learned, challenges faced, and solutions discovered during the development of this browser game.

## Project Setup (May 24, 2025)

### Git Repository Setup

**Concepts Learned:**
- Git branching strategies (main/dev workflow)
- Repository mirroring between Gitea and GitHub
- Project structure planning

**Process:**
1. Created local repository in `~/gitea/smiddleto/make-your-game`
2. Initialized git with main branch
3. Created initial project structure
4. Set up documentation framework

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup and documentation structure"
```

**Completed Steps:**
- ✓ Created initial project structure with directories for docs, src, and tests
- ✓ Set up basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- ✓ Made initial commit on main branch
- ✓ Created dev branch
- ✓ Added Gitea remote (origin)
- ✓ Added git_branches.sh script for branch management

### Next Steps:
1. Set up GitHub mirroring
2. Push to Gitea remote
3. Review project brief (need to get the content from grit:lab)
4. Begin game design based on requirements
